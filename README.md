# No Red Ink Submission

This program reads in from a .csv which holds questions.  Upon running the
program the user is prompted to input a number for how many questions he or she
would like to receive. The user is provided the question id for each question 
for the amount of questions requested. If a negative value is given the user is
displayed a message asking he or she to input a positive value.
